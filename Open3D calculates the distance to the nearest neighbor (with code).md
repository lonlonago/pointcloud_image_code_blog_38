#  Introduction to the algorithm 

##  1. Overview 

   First, use K-nearest neighbor search to find the nearest neighbor of each point, then calculate the Euclidean distance from each point to the nearest neighbor, and finally color render according to the distance. 

##  2. Main functions 

   compute_nearest_neighbor_distance function in Open3D calculates the Euclidean distance from each point to its nearest neighbor.
