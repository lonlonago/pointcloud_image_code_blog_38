#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   In the building point cloud, there is obvious difference between the normal vector of the elevation point and the normal vector of the plane point, and the segmentation of the elevation point and the plane point can be realized by setting the corresponding threshold according to the component of the normal vector in the Z direction.
